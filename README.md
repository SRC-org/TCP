# TCP-Microcontrollers

The SRCâ€™s Train Communication Protocol (TCP) is a protocol for multiple cars in a train to communicate with one another. This allows the brakes, lights, etc. in multiple cars to be controlled from one master car. To extremely simplify how it works, you install one Main Controller per car and install different modules and interfaces to enable different controls (lighting, decouple, etc.).
